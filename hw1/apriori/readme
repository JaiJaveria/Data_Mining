main.cpp: includes exact implementation
test.cpp: contains implementation of apriori with the frequency of each frequent itemset printed at start in the following format:

frequencies of each frequent itemsets printed in each line
empty line
frequent itemsets (items are in ASCII order) with each itemset in sorted global order, where each itemset corresponds to the frequency order printed at the start


verified test cases: input, input1, input2 (frequencies of frequent itemsets and frequent itemsets match as expected)
